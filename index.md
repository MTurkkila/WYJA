### My feelings about My Experience of Writing
For me writing has always been challenging and pinpointing why exactly is difficult. It might be some kind of insecurity in a sense that if I don't write, I don't have to send it for supervisors or referees and I don't get negative feedback or something. Therefore, I really need time to get myself into right headspace. Once I get started, I get the work done. However, this usually results in binge writing in weekends that is not sustainable and leads to more negative feelings about writing.

On the positive side, once I get the writing done and I'm pleased with my text, I get nice sense of accomplishment and pride. I do hope to learn more progressive writing habits to get more these positive feelings and less anxiousness.

### Common Elements in My Negative Feelings about Writing
* Procrastination due anxiousness 
* Feeling lazy due to procrastination
* Angry and disappointed in myself due to not writing
* Feelings of inadequacy 

### Common elements in My Positive Experiences of Writing
* Getting good feedback or even praise
* Sense of relevance or meaning for my writing
