## Week 1 - Deciding My Plan for Writing
### My feelings about My Experience of Writing
For me writing has always been challenging and pinpointing why exactly is difficult. It might be some kind of insecurity in a sense that if I don't write, I don't have to send it for supervisors or referees and I don't get negative feedback or something. Therefore, I really need time to get myself into right headspace. Once I get started, I get the work done. However, this usually results in binge writing in weekends that is not sustainable and leads to more negative feelings about writing.

On the positive side, once I get the writing done and I'm pleased with my text, I get nice sense of accomplishment and pride. I do hope to learn more progressive writing habits to get more these positive feelings and less anxiousness.

### Common Elements in My Negative Feelings about Writing
* Procrastination due anxiousness 
* Feeling lazy due to procrastination
* Angry and disappointed in myself due to not writing
* Feelings of inadequacy 

### Common elements in My Positive Experiences of Writing
* Getting good feedback or even praise
* Sense of relevance or meaning for my writing
* Rereading previous text and liking my own writing

|Distraction obstacles|Expected Interference|

### Possible Solutions to My Interruptions and Obstacles
Before reading the solutions-webpage, here are some solutions I have used already. I usually turn of my email when writing to not get distracted and I also allow myself some time to get other things done so they do not occupy my head too much. This course is the solution for emotional obstacles and to learn new, good writing habits. I do not consider confidence major obstacle any more as I have gained more confidence with the few writing projects have done. However, the lack of confidence still raises its ugly head sometimes.

So, after reading the solutions to my obstacles and some others, I think most solutions have already been discussed within the book or I have used or at least tried them. Still it is great to hear (read?) that I'm not the only one with obstacles and problems with writing. Main solutions I intend to adopt is to try writing even when I'm not in the right mood and trust that feelings will follow.

I've chosen SciQua track with revision/drafting pathway and my article will be experimental. I plan to write 20 hours a week and plan to submit by the end of the year.

Not much to say about _day_ 3 as I have already chosen my article. However, it did remind me that I have couple of other drafts or ideas I could develop into articles later. Perhaps while I'm writing my dissertation summary or while it's being reviewed.

Day 4, I'll need more drafting than just revision.

Day 5, I have and will use multiple spaces. More important are my noise cancelling headphones and good ambient or instrumental music. Also some metal to wake me up sometimes.
For this paper I'll be using Latex on Overleaf. That take care of citations (along with Mendeley) and file backups. Additionally, I regularly take manual backups.
Co-authorship is quite clear with my supervisors.

### Some Reflection
This book speaks to me and I recognize myself in many examples of binge writers and bad writing habits. Previously I have done most of my writing only when I had plenty of time and was jealous for people who could just write without first takin an hour or two to get into right mindset. I have hoped to learn to write in smaller chunks and it is great to see that that is the aim of this book and course. Thus, I feel like this course will be tremendously beneficial for me.

For some time now I have thought that my ideal (work)day would include reading, writing and coding (programming/data analysis/scientific computing). With this course I hope to get the confidence to arrange my days to be as close as possible to this ideal. Maybe 15 to 60 minutes each would suffice. I just need to accept and internalize it.

## Week 2: Advancing My Argument
### What is new about my article
My third article will continue the work done in my previous article in which I developed method to construct new materialist network data from video data. The new article will quantitatively analyze the constructed networks and correlate different networks or network measures. This combination of new materialist research and network-based approaches is new and the results quantitative roles and contributions of human and non-human actors. Thus, my methods are new and yield new type of results and insights to learning phenomenon with novel theoretical framework.
